# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the inverse of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step1 : 

Start the program and import the NumPy library, which provides functions for matrix operations.

### Step 2: 

Define the given matrix by storing its elements inside a NumPy array.

### Step 3: 

Use the built-in function numpy.linalg.inv() to calculate the inverse of the matrix.

### Step 4: 

Display (print) the resulting inverse matrix on the screen.
